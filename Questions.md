5. DSA - implementations in Python
6. Solve Striver DSA questions 1/191
7. Graph RAG - good, uses Knowledge Graph - but has high cost.
8. HopFields networks - good to know,
9. KAN - cutting edge - good to know.
10. Writing HTTP protocol from scratch
11. Procrastination: Cutting Distraction - Be clear of what I am going to do. Be brutal with the efforts till the momentum hits.
	1. 3 reasons of procrastination:
		1. Fear of failure or effort wasted: work on V0 = do preparations.
		2. Overwhelm: Focus on just the first step. Not the end result.
		3. Values not Aligning: verify if the values are really incongruent. If not, It's just boredom and make the task connected/engaging (fun is not the focus here).
	3. Stuck in V0: only doing preparations than actually doing the work: Do it for 5 minutes or 25 minutes. Engage with the work. Add Accountability.
